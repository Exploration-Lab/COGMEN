> **Abstract:** *Emotions are an inherent part of human interactions, and consequently, it is imperative to develop AI systems that understand and recognize human emotions. During a conversation involving various people, a person’s emotions are influenced by the other speaker’s utterances and their own emotional state over the utterances. In this paper, we propose COntextualized Graph Neural Network based Multimodal Emotion recognitioN (COGMEN) system that leverages local information (i.e., inter/intra dependency between speakers) and global information (context). The proposed model uses Graph Neural Network (GNN) based architecture to model the complex dependencies (local and global information) in a conversation. Our model gives state-of-theart (SOTA) results on IEMOCAP and MOSEI datasets, and detailed ablation experiments
show the importance of modeling information at both levels*

## Requirements

- We use PyG (PyTorch Geometric) for the GNN component in our architecture. [RGCNConv](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#torch_geometric.nn.conv.RGCNConv) and [TransformerConv](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#torch_geometric.nn.conv.TransformerConv)

- We use [comet](https://comet.ml) for logging all our experiments and its Bayesian optimizer for hyperparameter tuning. 

- For textual features we use [SBERT](https://www.sbert.net/).
### Installations
- [Install PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)

- [Install Comet.ml](https://www.comet.ml/docs/python-sdk/advanced/)
